      <p>There’s something special about our games. We believe that games should challenge the creativity of the individuals who play them. This holds true for all our games, no matter how casual, action-packed or story driven. We feel that this is one of the key factors to creating a memorable experience. An experience that will be remembered for a long time by those who play our games.</p> <br>

      <p>We also believe in making games that will have a long lasting and hardcore crowd. Therefore we take great care to integrate support models that make sense and that allow for continued development. They should become a living product, so that we can support our products for as long as people want to play them.</p> <br>

      <p>We pride ourselves on being a reliable studio with great affection for our community. One of our main goals is never to divide our community through DLC in any of our games. We have made sure to give players free expansions and upgrades, with only cosmetic items at additional costs to help support the game as a living product.</p> <br>
