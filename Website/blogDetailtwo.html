          <p>The environment also dynamically shifts throughout the gameplay. The simple bullet hell will get more and more complicated to push the player to get better at figuring out the pattern. We also decided that the player would not be able to fight or destroy the bullets and the pillar since it will destroy most of the difficulty that we are trying to aim for. Also, as for the dynamic environment, the player needs to do a lot of platforming and activating triggers in order to proceed through the level. This way, we allow players to strategically plan out their route and every players would get their unique experiences in their first playthrough. The aesthetics of the environment also shifts as the player goes deeper into the system, from simple geometric shape to more defined architectures.  This is to showcase that the character is regaining more and more of her memory back (part of the story). </p> <br>
          <p>If it is not clear enough, we really want to provide the player a sense of open-endedness. The player is allowed to choose between multiple weapons to find the one that suit their playstyles. They can also plan out their own unique routes to complete the level/puzzle. Lastly, we limited the one-time usage of essences to 200, therefore giving the player more choices on whether they want to store up their essences for current battle or future ones. </p> <br>
