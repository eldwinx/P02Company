          <br>
          <p>This story is basically what happened before the game started. Just for reference. </p> <br>
          <p>-- Starts here --</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2097 - Humanity faced the biggest threat from unknown planet with power that were out of human’s imagination.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2099 - An unknown disease spread to wipe out the remaining survivors. In order to keep the dream of humanity alive, ‘Project Noct’ was placed. The goal is to pick the genetically gifted young kids and make them into the living weapon to fight the unknown.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2103 - A young girl called ‘Eris’ and a young boy named ‘Noah’ were borned, their mother died to the disease shortly after. They were called ‘cursed child’ by the rest. Their father was one of the biggest scientist among the organization. After his wife passed away, he became weaker and weaker by the days, eventually the disease infected him. In his mind, humanity was doomed to fail. However, he could not handle the thought of having his young child die to this world.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2104 - Their father passed away, however, before he got incinerated by the disease, he left both of his children a ‘gift’. A gift that will forever changed their story.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2112 - Both ‘Eris’ the sister and ‘Noah’ were invited by the organization. The organization promised them food and shelter. (Age 9) There were a lot of children within the shelter, they were raised by nuns and priests. However, every couple weeks one of the children get selected by the scientist and they were never been seen again. ‘Eris’ never trusted anyone, she became extremely protective to her brother.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2114 - ‘Eris’ and ‘Noah’ were selected by the organization. They witness their priest and nun, people who raised them, turned their back on the sibling. The sibling held hands until the scientist forcefully separated them. Noah was drugged and dragged into a room, while Eris was pushed into a tube. The scientist announced ‘test subject #299, please close your eyes’ as Eris tried to kick open the tube. A strong cloud of mist started filling the tube. Eris went into great suffering, she thought she was going to suffocated to death. A few minutes later, the scientist opened the tube, Eris fell out of the tube, lifeless. The scientists whispered to each other saying this is just another failure. However, Eris opened her eyes, she swiftly took the knife out of the security’s pocket and stabbed it through him. She then killed every scientist that was in that room. Eris did not know what was happening to her body, but it made her have inhuman strength and agility while also allow her cells to instantly heal any damage that she takes. That was not her main concern, she rushed her way to her brother. She heard scientists screaming in joy within Noah’s room. As she opens the door, she witness her brother’s body was split open, and one of the scientist was holding a blue machine ball. Eris eyes turned blurry as her rage consumed her. That day, ‘Project Noct’ came to an end. Eris killed every single human within the facility as she held her brother’s body and the blue core to her heart. “Sister is that you?” the blue core started blinking as they sat under a tree. As the blue core slowly started forming into a machine life-form. </p> <br>
          <p>Year 2120 - Humanity unfortunately came to an end. Noah and Eris in order to survive started fighting against the unknown. Noah started exploring his power, as he duplicated more and more of himself. However, things came with a cost.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2122 - Eris and Noah successfully eliminated last remaining unknowns from the deserted planet. However, Noah or Noahs has turned rampage as he couldn’t stop fighting. Noahs started fighting against each other, cannibalizing and slaughtering each other. Eris although she has an immortal body, she felt her inside was infected by the disease and she was going to die. Eris could not handle the sight of her brother killing each other. She set herself a mission, to eliminate the core of Noah and set her brother free.</p> <br>
          <p>Year 2125 - After destroying numerous of her brother’s duplicates, Eris finally found the core of her long gone brother. She stabbed her sword through his body. Destroying the only one that she loved. She kneels down with the empty machine and slowly allows the disease to consume her.</p> <br>
