        <h2>Adventure Of Blobby Beta!</h2>
          <br>
          <p id="quote">"Real Life? Never Heard Of That Server."</p>
          <br>
          <p>Adventure of Blobby is a 2D platformer created in Unity on the PC and mobile platform.The game is about a lost blob trying its hardest to navigate through the dangerous forest, solving multiple puzzles and defeat spooky monsters to find and reach its family. The game focuses on the mechanics which allow Blobby to transform into different shapes to overcome the obstacles in the game.</p> <br>
          <p>Our theme of the game was initially set in a horror, dark themed apocalyptic environment where human has almost extinct, only micro-organism lives. However, as our artist create our assets, the style changes to be brighter and adventurous. </p> <br>
          <p>After several meeting with play testers, we follow the suggestions and improved our clunky and buggy mechanics. More specifically, we removed the jumping function from the character’s circular form, and also the jumping and moving function from the triangle form to promote meaningful transforming decision</p> <br>
          <p>Level 2 is already completed and all the assets were added. We put our main focus on level 2. A lot of location doesn’t feel convincing for jumping. There are still a lot of bugs (ex. Moving platform moves slightly upwards after touching). Disappearing platform doesn’t replenish itself after removing them. Some checkpoint doesn’t work. The level is hard to navigate. The background moves too fast, and some player gets dizzy because of that.</p> <br>
