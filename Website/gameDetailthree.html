          <p>The game world is set in Athena’s android memory system. The 3D environment started off with simple geometric shapes to represent the current memory Athena is holding in her memory system (plain). As the player proceed through the stages of the game, architecture and details will be slowly added into the environment to indicate the player’s process and presents the current stage of the story</p> <br>

          <p>The game included elements of dynamically shifting environments open-endedness.
Bullet hell will have different patterns where the player will have to figure out how to pass through it by dodging the bullets. The player cannot fight or destroy the bullet and pillars.
Platforms and triggers require the player to strategically plan out their route to pass through the level.
The environment shift throughout the stages which showcased that the character is regaining her memory back. As the player proceeds through the stages, the more defined architecture will be added to the overall environment.
Choices between two weapons and different abilities depending on the player’s play style. The sword lets the player performs melee combat. In addition, if the player chooses to use the spear, the player will switch to performing range abilities. These two weapons choices give the player the freedom of how the player wants to fight the battle.</p> <br>
