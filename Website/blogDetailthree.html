        <h2>Athena's Memory moving into Unreal Engine4!</h2>

          <p>UE 4 graphics image When it comes to graphics, Unreal Engine 4 is really a next-gen game engine. Capable of creating graphics on par with games you see being released on next-gen game consoles. From complex particle simulations systems to advanced dynamic lighting. Of course, with the upcoming Unity 5, there has also been a big graphical increase. Although, the release date has yet to be set in stone. Graphics of course are not everything, and quite simply you probably don't need to create a game that competes with today's triple A titles. That being said, Unreal Engine 4 has the capabilities to really create any type of visual style that you want 2D or 3D. It's always good to be able to have the option to push the graphics further if you choose to do so.</p> <br>
          <p>Unreal Engine 4 has Blueprint visual scripting. A node-based scripting method right inside UE4. Technically you don't ever need to write a single line of code. This is great for quickly prototyping levels, and you can even create entire games using Blueprint. If you're not a programming wizard, but just want to make a game, this can make Unreal Engine 4 a great option for you. Of course, there are limitations to what Blueprint is capable of, but if you're new to game design it can be a great way to get your feet wet. If you want to use Unreal Engine 4 for things like visualizations and architectural walk-throughs Blueprint would be excellent for that because you won't have to worry about writing code and it can be done very quickly.</p> <br>
